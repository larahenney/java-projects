Some small java projects and classes

This is an assortment of various small classes and programs I've made. 

AreaCalculator: 

AreaCalculator is the main class for calculating the area of various shapes as well as describing the formula to calculate area. It's pretty simple but it started out as my first program in java that used multiple classes. As the first thing that really clicked with me as far as java goes I thought it was appropriate to post! 

As of right now each of the shape classes only have one method but I may go back and add more methods if I feel like it. 

Monsters: 

This is another basic object/class project that focuses more on the methods created in them and the inherited properties a main Monster class. It creates a few instances of said monsters. 

List Practice: 

This is some basic list practice for indexing books into a library system.
